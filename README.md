## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on the initial exploration and analysis of the Ontario rental market using listing data from **Zumper**. 

The goal was to understand the "real-time" state of the leasing market by analyzing scraped listing prices, property types, and regional distribution across major Ontario hubs. 

### 🧬 **The Foundation for RentPulse**
This repository serves as **Phase 1 (The Foundation)** of my rental market research. 
* It established the baseline for understanding city-level price variations.
* The insights gained here directly informed the development of my advanced AI forecasting engine: **[RentPulse-AI](https://github.com/Abigail6on/RentPulse)**.
